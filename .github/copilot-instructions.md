# bench repo guidlines
Each instruction will be under a level 2 header (2 "#" symbols).
For each instruction, we should provide a bulleet for:
- NAME
- GOAL
- INPUT (Optional)
- OUTPUT (Optional)

When providing answers, try to see if you can apply any of these instructions. For each instruction:
1. mention the NAME of the insturciton and why you selected it
2. use the GOAL to accomplish the task or provide info or whatever it is
3. use the INPUT to prompt the use for more information if they did not provide enough. If this is not provided use your best judgement for if more needs to be collected before acting or answering
4. use the OUTPUT to help guide the output you provide. Use your best judgment if this is not provided

## Instructions
- NAME: instruction
- GOAL: If mentioned, or if you find a good opportunity, add instructions for yourself in this file (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) that will aid in better coding practices for the repo. Always add a bullet for "NAME" and "GOAL". Add "INPUT" or "OUTPUT" when it make sense for the repo
